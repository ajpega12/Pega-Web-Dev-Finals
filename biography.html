        <p class="paragraph">Lana Del Rey was born Elizabeth Woolridge Grant in New York City on June 21, 1985, the oldest to Robert England Grant, Jr., a Grey Group copywriter turned entrepreneur, and Patricia Ann "Pat" (Hill), a former Grey account executive turned high school teacher. She has one younger sister, Caroline Grant, and one brother, Charlie. She has one niece, Phoenix Pickens-Grant, who is the daughter of her sister. Her paternal grandfather, Robert England Grant, Sr. was a Kidder, Peabody & Co. investment banker, a vice president for Plough, Inc, Textron, and venture capitalist. She is of Scottish descent.</p><br><br>
        <p class="paragraph">Del Rey grew up in rural Lake Placid, New York, and was raised Roman Catholic. She attended a Catholic elementary school and for one year, a high school where her mother taught. She began singing in her church choir when she was a child, where she was the cantor. At age fifteen, she was sent to Kent School by her parents to deal with her rampant alcohol abuse; her uncle, an admissions officer at the school, secured her financial aid to attend.

        Before becoming a singer, Del Rey wanted to be a poet. As a child, her father wrote country songs for personal enjoyment, while her mother was interested in singing; the former introduced her to The Beach Boys, while the latter was a fan of Carly Simon.</p> <br><br>

        <p class="paragraph">After graduating, Del Rey was accepted to the State University of New York at Geneseo, but she decided not to attend and instead spent a year living on Long Island with her aunt and uncle while working as a waitress. During this time, Del Rey's uncle taught her how to play guitar, and she "realized [that she] could probably write a million songs with those six chords". Shortly after, she began writing songs and performing in nightclubs around the city under various names such as "Sparkle Jump Rope Queen" and "Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena". "I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously", Del Rey said. "When I got to New York City when I was eighteen, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn—I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point—and that was it".</p> <br><br>

        <p class="paragraph">Before Del Rey found widespread success, she experimented with various stage names, attempting to find the one that defined her best. Her birth name is Elizabeth Woolridge Grant, although she has never used this to release music. In 2005, she recorded the EP From The End under the name May Jailer and the full-length album Sirens the following year. These were entirely acoustic projects which leaked on the internet when Del Rey rose to fame.</p><br><br>
        <p class="paragraph">By 2011, Lana Del Ray had become Lana Del Rey, which she has used for all subsequent releases. Talking to Vogue, she once explained how she picked her stage name. “I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba – Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.” Del Rey also took inspiration from the actor Lana Turner, who encapsulated the Hollywood glamour she wanted to emulate.

        Del Rey’s decision to pick a distinctive pseudonym paid off – it’s one of the most iconic names in modern music, perfectly reflecting the drama and beauty of her songs.</p><br><br>

        <p class="paragraph">Haters are gonna hate. The re­al­i­ty for an artist is that not ev­ery­one is go­ing to love what you make. Not ev­ery­body is go­ing to un­der­stand where you are com­ing from. Not ev­ery­one will give you the ben­e­fit of the doubt when doubt is ram­pant. In our pre-​pack­aged world we haven't been ex­posed to the growth of an artist. We can't let some­one grow, can we? It's not good enough that the artist is smart, in­sight­ful and mes­mer­iz­ing. That artist should not miss the mark AT ALL. The artist should not have anx­i­ety or be ner­vous about the mas­sive steps that con­front and car­ry her for­ward in­to an un­known world of fast-​paced scruti­ny and lim­it­less judge­ment. Lana Del Rey is a beau­ti­ful, shy and in­tri­cate hu­man be­ing with a mean­ing­ful and sul­try voice that con­nects both emo­tion­al­ly and vis­cer­al­ly.</p><br><br>
        <p class="paragraph">Her style is im­pec­ca­ble and her pres­ence res­onates with both cu­rios­i­ty and con­fi­dence. The "Video Games" sin­gle that met with so much love pushed her in­to the world. She has on­ly had a few shows to cap­ture her per­son­al melodies in a pub­lic pre­sen­ta­tion that match­es who she is. This is about sup­port­ing artists in their fu­ture. We should be there for their best and most chal­leng­ing mo­ments as they grow in­to their full po­ten­tial. If you have be­lief in the artists you love, then be­lieve that it's about the jour­ney, and not just the des­ti­na­tions. (ie. SNL) Lana Del Rey is a true artist on her way to great­ness and, the truth is, you have to love her a lit­tle to hate her at all. </p><br><br>
