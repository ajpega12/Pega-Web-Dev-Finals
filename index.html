              <p class ="tour-price"> Lana Del Rey is an American singer-songwriter
                 known for pairing glamorously morose musical themes with classic Americana and a nostalgic, cinematic visual style. Del Rey’s songs typically 
                 focus on relatable, melancholic experiences wrapped in a cultural pastiche of Hollywood’s golden era.
                 Her music is noted for its cinematic quality and exploration of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia, with frequent references to contemporary pop culture and 1950s–70s Americana1</p>

              <p class="tour-price">The Ultraviolence album is a distinct summation of everything the artist represents. From the choral and sultry title track to the psychedelic "West Coast," Del Rey weaves a flowing album of melancholic self-reflection through dream pop and blues rock. "Brooklyn Baby" and "Old Money" both draw inspiration from eras of the early 20th century, with a haunting spin on the style that only Lana Del Rey could create. Her iconic cover of "The Other Woman" and the dark, lush "Black Beauty" allow this album to surpass the rest of her discography.</p>

                  Lana Del Rey Talks  Why She Loves Valentine’s Day 19 January 2024
                </h1>
                <p class="story-paragraph">
                  There are few people worthy of an 11pm phone call on a school night, but Lana Del Rey is certainly one of those folks. After all, less than a month into 2024, it’s already shaping up to be the year of Lana: the singer is set to headline Coachella in April, and she’s also nominated for five Grammy Awards this year, including an Album of the Year nod for the masterful Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd. “It’s fun because I executively produced it, like I did my last two albums,” Del Rey tells Vogue of her nominations. But there’s more… 
                </p>
                <p class="story-paragraph">
                  Del Rey has now become the newest face of Skims, fronting a Valentine’s Day collection out 23 January. Modelling for fashion brands is nothing new for Del Rey, who has also been tapped as a Gucci muse in the past. The collaboration with Kim Kardashian (and her multi-billion-dollar shapewear brand), she says, is especially personal. “I love Kim, and I love her family,” Del Rey says. “Me and my sister are huge fans of them, and have been watching them forever.” (The pair also have history: back in 2014, Del Rey performed at Kardashian and ex-husband Kanye West’s pre-wedding festivities.)

                <p class="story-paragraph">
                  Lana Del Rey doesn’t need a “Candy Necklace” to serve up a sweet red carpet look.

                  As always, the “A&W” singer, 38, arrived on the red carpet at the 2024 Grammys in a head-turning look on Sunday.
                  
                  She wore a sweet floral black dress with puff sleeves and a perfectly coquette bow in her hair. She accessorized with little black gloves — with more bows! — a black handbag and Fred Leighton jewels. The singer had even more bows on her heels, really leaning into the current trend.
